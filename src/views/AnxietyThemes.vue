      <hr />

          Making a sweeping negative conclusion, without considering other more
          likely possibilities.
          <p>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> “If I approach that woman, she will reject me,
            everybody will see it, and they will all think I am a total loser.”

        <b> 5. Emotional Reasoning: </b>
        <span>
          Thinking something must be true because you “feel” it so strongly.

          <p>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> “ I “feel” like I am stupid when I speak publicly,
            so I am stupid.”

        <b> 6. Labeling: </b>

      <p>
        <b> 7. Selective Abstraction / Tunnel Vision: </b>
        <span>
          Over-attending to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole
          picture.

          <p>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> “I stumbled over my words on this job interview –
            they will never hire me now.”
          </p>
        </span>
      </p>

          <p>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> ““I should never feel any anxiety in social
            situations.”
          </p>
        </span>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <b> 9. Comparison: </b>
        <span>

          than them.”

          <p>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> “My friend doesn’t have social anxiety - her life is
            perfect!”
          </p>
        </span>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <b> 10. Mind reading: </b>
        <span>
          Believing you know what others are thinking, without considering other
          possibilities.

          <p>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> “Everybody is looking at me, and they all think I am
            a dork.”
          </p>
        </span>

        <b> 11. Personalization: </b>
        <span>

          considering other possibilities.

          <p>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> “Those people I met at the party left early because
            they couldn’t stand me.”
