      1. All-or-nothing thinking – Viewing a situation in only two categories
      instead of on a continuum. EXAMPLE: “Everybody has to like me.” 2.
      Catastrophizing – Making a sweeping negative conclusion, without
      considering other more likely possibilities. EXAMPLE: “If I approach that
      woman, she will reject me, everybody will see it, and they will all think
      I am a total loser.” 3. Magnifying – Unreasonably magnifying the
      importance of something. EXAMPLE: “If I speak up in class and stumble over
      my words, it will be horrible.” 4. Discounting or minimizing the positive
      – Unreasonably telling your self that positive experiences or qualities do
      not count. EXAMPLE: “I was able to give that work presentation last
      week…but there is no way I can do that today!” 5. Emotional reasoning –
      Thinking something must be true because you “feel” it so strongly.
      EXAMPLE: I “feel” like I am stupid when I speak publicly, so I am stupid.”
      6. Labeling – Putting a fixed, global label on your self without
      considering evidence that might lead to a less disastrous conclusion.
      EXAMPLE: “I am a social basket case – a “freak”.” 7. Selective Abstraction
      / Tunnel Vision – Over-attending to one negative detail instead of seeing
      the whole picture. EXAMPLE: “I stumbled over my words on this job
      interview – they will never hire me now.” 8. “Should” and “must”
      statements (perfectionism) – Having precise, fixed, unchangeable ideas of
      how things should be. EXAMPLE: “I should never feel any anxiety in social
      situations.” 9. Comparison – Comparing your experience to others’ and
      assuming you have it worse than them. EXAMPLE: “My friend doesn’t have
      social anxiety - her life is perfect!” 10. Mind reading – Believing you
      know what others are thinking, without considering other possibilities.
      EXAMPLE: “Everybody is looking at me, and they all think I am a dork.” 11.
      Personalization – Believing others are behaving in a certain way because
      of you, without considering other possibilities. EXAMPLE: “Those people I
      met at the party left early because they couldn’t stand me.”
